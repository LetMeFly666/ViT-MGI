2024-07-03 10:23:50.377910: I tensorflow/core/util/port.cc:110] oneDNN custom operations are on. You may see slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different computation orders. To turn them off, set the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0`.
2024-07-03 10:23:50.424293: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:182] This TensorFlow binary is optimized to use available CPU instructions in performance-critical operations.
To enable the following instructions: AVX2 AVX512F AVX512_VNNI FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

Some weights of ViTForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at data/vit_base_patch16_224/pytorch_model.bin and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- classifier.weight: found shape torch.Size([1000, 768]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([10, 768]) in the model instantiated
- classifier.bias: found shape torch.Size([1000]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([10]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
